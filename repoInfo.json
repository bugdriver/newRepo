An easy way to come up with a good description is to think ‘How would I explain what this project does in one or two sentences to someone at a dinner party?’ Those are the sentences you want to write down as your repo description. Before you publish, it also helps to run your description by someone who doesn’t work on your team. Do they have any suggestions?" ,"tags":["nodejs","todo"]}
